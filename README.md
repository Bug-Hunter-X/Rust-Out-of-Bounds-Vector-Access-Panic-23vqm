This repository demonstrates a common runtime panic in Rust stemming from accessing a vector element with an index outside its valid range.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code. The solution (`bugSolution.rs`) provides a corrected version utilizing safe indexing methods to prevent this panic.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and bounds checking in Rust to maintain program stability.
